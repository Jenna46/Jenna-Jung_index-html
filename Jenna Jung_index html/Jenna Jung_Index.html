      <h3>Origin and Evolution</h3>

      <p>During the Joseon Dynasty, which began in the 14th century, the hanbok evolved into a style distinct from the traditional clothing of neighboring countries like China or Japan, forming the archetype for later generations. The hanbok from this period is what people typically associate with traditional Korean attire.
        Initially influenced by nomadic cultures in northern Asia, it later incorporated elements from neighboring countries like China. Over time, the Hanbok has undergone numerous changes, but its core elements have remained consistent, reflecting the Korean ethos.
        <br>The term "hanbok" itself was created during the Gaehwagi period, in the late 19th century, to differentiate Korea's traditional clothing from Western-style clothing which was introduced through the Gabo Reform and as Korea opened its ports to Western influence. The distinction of class through clothing also weakened during this time.
        <br>Throughout its history, the hanbok has seen many changes and adaptations. It has been influenced by social changes, cultural exchanges with other countries, and modern fashion trends. Despite these changes, the hanbok remains a symbol of Korean culture and heritage, often worn during traditional festivals and celebrations.

        Today, there is a revival of interest in the hanbok, with modern interpretations and designs that reflect contemporary fashion while maintaining the essence of traditional Korean aesthetic.

      <h2>Obangsaek: The Colors of Harmony</h2>

      <h3>The Philosophy of Obangsaek</h3>
      <p>Each color has a meaning and assigned a cardinal direction plus center, making five colors of astute visual significance. The beautiful rainbow pattern on the sleeves of children兒s hanboks offers protection against malignant forces and the attention of the benign. The obangsaek is a design philiosophy in Korean food, the colors used in the palace, and of course mudangs still practice shamanstic rites using the spiritual meaning of the colors. 
        Often, the colors are attributed to 兩China兒 origin ying-yang, but it really seems the shamanism predates anything of ethnic Chinese. The meaning of the colors differ, and Koreans emphasize four directions plus center whereas Chinese settled on four cardinal directions. What is really impressive is that black, white, red, yellow, and blue are also five colors for design. The obangsaek primary colors blended and adjusted with black or white can make any shade of ogansaek colors.
        Thus, ogansaek secondary colors also have a place in Korean culture. Our ancient Korean ancestors embedded meaning through a special kind of spiritualism. The spiritualism is not religious in form, but expressed by observing practices involved in living life itself as Korean culture, a cultural spiritualism encompassed in Danilminjok seeking protection and fortune for everyone together as 辦葬. Modern Koreans hopefully will not be distracted too much by western influences, to continue rediscovering and understanding the deep Korean cultural and spiritual meanings even in something as simple as color theory.</p>

      <h3>Use in Hanbok</h3>

      <p>Hanbok colors were vibrant in traditional hanbok and correspond to the five elements of yin-and-yang theory: white (metal), red (fire), blue (wood), black (water), and yellow (earth). Colors were used to signify the social status of the wearer as well as marital status. Hanbok are often associated with resistance in modern Korea due to their white color. Folk plays, shamans wearing shamanist costumes, protestors in anti-establishment protests, and social activists and progressive politicians all wear this costume.
        The color white is extremely symbolic in Korea, representing honesty, integrity, and innocence. White clothing was banned in Korea as part of the Japanese occupation, and the country兒s citizens wore it as a symbol of resistance to the Japanese. In Korean culture, the white tiger is revered because its fur turns white when it reaches the end of its life and begins to understand the meaning of life. Wearing white not only demonstrated their appreciation for the white tiger and its spiritual significance, but it also demonstrated their opposition to Japanese imperialism.
        Hanbok colors have long been associated with certain meanings in Korean culture. Red is considered a color of luck and joy, which is why it is the most popular color used in hanboks. Blue is associated with long life and health, while yellow is a symbol of nobility and wealth. Green is typically seen as a sign of fertility and growth, while purple is associated with wisdom and spirituality. Orange and pink are often seen as colors of love, while white is seen as a sign of purity and innocence. Each of these colors can be used to express different attributes and emotions, making hanbok a unique and meaningful form of traditional clothing.
